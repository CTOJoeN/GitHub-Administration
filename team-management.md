## Teams in the GSA organization

The GSA GitHub organization is managed by creating and granting access to [teams](https://github.com/orgs/GSA/teams).  Each time that a new component in GSA is ready to be added to the GSA organization, a team should be created for that component and a point of contact should be picked who will be responsible for deciding who should be added to the team.  These points of contact should be tracked below.
